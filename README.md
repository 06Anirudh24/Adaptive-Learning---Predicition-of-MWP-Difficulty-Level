### Overview: -
In this study, a classifier has been built to predict the difficulty level of a given Algebra problem using Machine (Ensemble) Learning. Multiple types of features have been extracted for this purpose. These include: -
1. Word embeddings
2. Parts of speech tags (POS patterns extracted in the form of 3-grams)
3. Readability scores
4. Handcrafted features to account for difficulty level caused by the numerical values.
